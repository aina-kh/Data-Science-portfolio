Recently, someone has broken into my friend's house and has stolen almost all of her valuables. Now, she is looking for a new a place, since she does not feel safe in her neighbourhood anymore. However, the problem is that my friend does not know which neighbourhoods could be considered safe in Toronto, particularly in downtown. 

I decided to help her by creating a map of Break and Enter crime, which is classified as one of the Major Crime Indicators(MCI), specifically at apartments in the downtown of Toronto. I will also be using one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms - clustering with K-Means. However, the main focus of this project is to display the centroids of the clusters, rather than examining the clusters themselves. The data used for this project is available [here](http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/mci-2014-to-2017?geometry=-80.064%2C43.544%2C-78.663%2C43.891).
